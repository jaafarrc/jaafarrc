👋 Hello. I am Jaafar, a young Iraqi programmer specializing in game development, computer graphics, UI/UX design, and desktop applications. I am also a 2D animator and writer.\
⭐ My other interests include gaming (obviously :), especially shooters and fighting games; anime and cartoons, my favorite anime being *Fullmetal Alchemist*; football (a.k.a. soccer), though I neither watch it nor keep up with it, but rather just play it; and some linguistics, particularly constructed languages.\
💬 I speak Arabic natively, along with English and Esperanto at a fluent level.\
👨🏽‍💻 Most of [my software projects] are on [Codeberg] rather than GitHub.\
💻 I use NixOS as my daily desktop OS, and Niri as my desktop.\
📖 Learning: C++, Rust.\
