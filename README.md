👋 Hello. I am Jaafar, a young Iraqi programmer specializing in game development, computer graphics, UI/UX design, and desktop applications. I am also a 2D animator and writer.\
⭐ My other interests include anime and cartoons, football (a.k.a. soccer — I only play but don't watch), and some linguistics (particularly constructed languages).\
💬 I speak Arabic natively, along with English and Esperanto at a fluent level.\
